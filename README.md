Machine Learning (Coursera)


This is my solution to 1 to 6 week the programming assignments of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. After completing this course you will get a broad idea of Machine learning algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.

Rest are in part two

Contents
1. Lectures Slides
2. Solution to programming assignment
